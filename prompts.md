awesome job for an awesome design! but I believe you can do even better. please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore via long chain of thought to carefully and systematically explore how you will re-imagine an even more awesome and gorgeous design with equivalent user experience. then plan thoroughly and then create an even more comprehensive and detailed PRD for your re-imagined e-commerce website. you can consider to add the following elements as part of your re-imagined design and PRD.

awesome re-imagined design! now please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply re-imagine an equally awesome and comprehensive and informative `README.md` for the new GitHub repository at https://github.com/nordeim/Sparkle-Community-Hub.git  to host your awesome re-imagined design represented by your re-imagined PRD. make your README so compelling that new contributors will be immediately attracted to this awesomely gorgeous community hub platform. use at least 4000 words for the `README/md` in markdown format, add the following sections at appropriate point / sequence:

1. add / update a section to show / describe the project codebase file hierarchy
2. add / update a section for a flowchart diagram to describe the interactions between various files and modules
3. add / update a section to list and describe the files in the codebase file hierarchy 
4. Current features implemented (partially or fully), Roadmap for suggested improvements divided into two sections, one for the immediate and one for the long-term goals.
5. Clear and detailed deployment guide starting from the GitHub repository

awesome job! please put on the same deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically to create a detailed and comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` in markdown document that matches your re-imagined PRD and README.md. this document will help any new developer to build the whole codebase with confidence and accuracy, clear and logical description that gives no ambiguity to execute the coding. think carefully and deeply how you will build the codebase step by step, then incorporate the steps as detailed execution plan in one section of the `Project Architecture Document`. the document must be faithful to the PRD and README details. please try your very best so as not to disappoint me. proceed carefully so as not to miss out important details in the codebase building process and guideline. thank you and good luck!

awesome job! now put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply explore a detailed and comprehensive execution plan to build the codebase based on your re-imagined PRD and PAD in phases, for each phase, specify the goals and objectives and with a list of files to complete that phase. specify in detail how each file should include, specify details like its interfaces (interaction with other files and modules) and its purpose.  include a checklist for each file to build. the execution plan should be so clear and logical that even a new developer can code it with accuracy and minimal error. plan carefully how you will structure the execution plan with integrated checklist and what details to include before finally create the execution plan in markdown format. please plan carefully then execute this task.

Next, create a complete database schema for your improved PRD and PAD for Postgresql within ```sql and ``` tags
