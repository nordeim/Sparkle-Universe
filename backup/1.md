<think>
The user wants me to design a comprehensive blog forum web application for "Sparkle YouTube fans". They're asking for a Project Requirements Document that goes beyond basic requirements and demonstrates exceptional design thinking and strategic planning.

Let me think about this systematically:

1. The target audience is YouTube fans, specifically of "Sparkle" - this suggests we need features that integrate with YouTube culture and content
2. They want "wow factor" and "mind-blowing" designs - I should include innovative features that elevate this beyond a standard forum
3. The tech stack is modern (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma) - I can leverage these for advanced features
4. They want comprehensive admin capabilities - I should design a powerful, data-driven admin dashboard

I'll create a detailed PRD that includes:
- Innovative features like YouTube video embedding, real-time features, gamification
- Advanced user engagement features
- Sophisticated admin analytics and moderation tools
- Mobile-first, accessible design principles
- Security and performance considerations
- Phased development approach
- Future enhancement roadmap

This should demonstrate strategic thinking about community building, user engagement, and long-term platform growth.
